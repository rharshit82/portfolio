![How to Use the math.Min() Function in Go](/static/images/blog/How-to-Use-the-math.Min-Function-in-Go.png)

In this guide, we'll focus on one of its mathematical functions - `math.Min()`. The `math.Min()` function in Go helps you find out which of two numbers is smaller. To use it, you first add the `math` package to your code. Then, you can compare two numbers. For example, if you have two numbers, `a := 10.5` and `b := 9.2`, using `math.Min(a, b)` will tell you that `9.2` is the smaller number.

There are some special cases to know. If one of your numbers is `-Inf`, the answer will always be `-Inf`. If one of them is not a real number, called `NaN`, then the answer will be `NaN`. Also, when comparing `-0` and `0`, the answer will be `-0`. Knowing these helps you get the right answer every time.

### **Purpose of the `math.Min()` Function**

Simply put, `math.Min()` helps find out which of two numbers is smaller. Instead of writing many lines of code to figure it out, this function gives the answer in just one line. It's a tool that makes things easy and neat.

## **Syntax of** **`math.Min()`**

```
func Min(x, y float64) float64
```

## How to Use the Math.Min() Function in Go?

Now, let's look at how to use `math.Min()`.

Here's a basic code example:

```
package main

import (
"fmt"
"math"
)

func main() {
  a := 5.2
  b := 3.8

  smallerNumber := math.Min(a, b)
  fmt.Println("The smaller number is:", smallerNumber)
}
```

In this code:

- We first import two packages: `fmt` for printing and `math` for our `math.Min()` function.
- We have two numbers, `a` and `b`.
- We use `math.Min(a, b)` to find out the smaller number and store it in `smallerNumber`.
- Finally, we print the result.

Run this, and you'll see the output: "The smaller number is: 3.8" because 3.8 is smaller than 5.2.

## **Why Use the `math.Min()` Function?**

In the [world of programming](https://harshit.me/your-first-go-program-hello-world/), sometimes simple tasks can eat up a lot of our time. Finding out which of two numbers is smaller is one such task. Here's where `math.Min()` comes in handy.

### **Comparing Two Numbers**

Imagine you're making a game, and you want to give a bonus to the player with the lower score. Or maybe you're writing an app that compares prices to show the cheaper option. In both cases, you need to find out the smaller number quickly.

Here's an example:

```
package main

import (
"fmt"
"math"
)

func main() {
  price1 := 15.99
  price2 := 12.49

  cheaperPrice := math.Min(price1, price2)
  fmt.Println("The cheaper price is:", cheaperPrice)
}
```

This program will tell us that the cheaper price is 12.49.

## **Dealing with Integers in Go's `math.Min()` Function**

The `math.Min()` function in Go is built to handle `float64` values. When working with integers, a [type conversion](https://harshit.me/data-types-and-variables-in-go/) is necessary to effectively use the function. By first converting integers to `float64` type, you can utilize the function, and then, if required, convert the result back to an integer. This approach ensures that you can seamlessly determine the smaller of two integers using `math.Min()`.

### **Example:**

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	x := 7   // int value
	y := 8   // int value

	smaller := math.Min(float64(x), float64(y))  // Convert to float64 before comparing

	fmt.Println("The smaller number is:", int(smaller))  // Convert back to int for displaying
}
```

### **Output:**

```
The smaller number is: 7
```

## **Return Values of `math.Min()` in Go**

| Input Values          | Return Value | Explanation                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Min(-Inf, any number) | `-Inf`       | `-Inf` is smaller than all other numbers, so it's always the return when one value is `-Inf`.   |
| Min(any number, -Inf) | `-Inf`       | Same as above, the order doesn't matter.                                                        |
| Min(NaN, any number)  | `NaN`        | `NaN` stands for "Not a Number", so the comparison is undefined and the result is always `NaN`. |
| Min(any number, NaN)  | `NaN`        | Same reason as above, order doesn't matter.                                                     |
| Min(-0, 0)            | `-0`         | Go differentiates between `-0` (negative zero) and `0` (positive zero), returning `-0` here.    |
| Min(0, -0)            | `-0`         | Even if the order is swapped, it still returns `-0`.                                            |

## **Advanced Usage of math.min()**

Now that we've covered common mistakes, let's learn more about`math.Min()`.

### **Combining with Other Functions**

You can mix `math.Min()` with other functions for more power. For example, imagine you want to find a smaller number and then round it. You can do this:

```
package main

import (
"fmt"
"math"
)

func main() {
  a := 5.7
  b := 6.3

  smallest := math.Min(a, b)
  roundedSmallest := math.Round(smallest)

  fmt.Println("The rounded smaller number is:", roundedSmallest)
}
```

Here, `math.Round()` rounds the result of `math.Min()`. Neat, right?

### **Nesting `math.Min()`**

But what if you have more than two numbers? You can nest `math.Min()` to compare them.

Example: To find the smallest of three numbers:

```
package main

import (
"fmt"
"math"
)

func main() {
  x := 10.5
  y := 8.3
  z := 9.7

  smallest := math.Min(x, math.Min(y, z))

  fmt.Println("The smallest number is:", smallest)
}
```

By nesting `math.Min()`, we first compare `y` and `z`, then take that result and compare it with `x`.

## **Alternative Methods for math.Min()**

While `math.Min()` is handy, there are other ways in Go to find the smaller of two numbers.

### **Using Conditional Statements**

One common way is to use `if-else` statements.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  a := 7.5
  b := 6.8
  var smaller float64

  if a < b {
    smaller = a
  } else {
    smaller = b
  }

  fmt.Println("The smaller number is:", smaller)
}
```

Here, we're directly checking: "Is `a` less than `b`?". If true, `a` is the smaller number. If not, `b` is the smaller number. Simple!

### **Custom Functions**

Another neat way is to make your own function to get the job done.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func getSmaller(x, y float64) float64 {
  if x < y {
    return x
  }
  return y
}

func main() {
  a := 10.4
  b := 9.2
  smaller := getSmaller(a, b)

  fmt.Println("The smaller number is:", smaller)
}
```

With `getSmaller()`, we made our own tool to find the smaller number. This way, if you have special rules or extra steps, you can add them right into your function.

## **Conclusion**

Finding the smaller of two numbers in Go can be done in many ways. While `math.Min()` is a quick and clean method, sometimes the situation calls for something different. Whether using a `if-else` statement or crafting your own custom function, Go offers the flexibility to get results in a way that fits your needs. Remember, the best method often depends on the task at hand, so understanding all your options is key. Keep experimenting, keep learning, and always aim to write code that's both efficient and easy to understand. Happy coding!
